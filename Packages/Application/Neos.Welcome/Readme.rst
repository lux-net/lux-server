The Welcome package
-------------------

The Welcome package provides a simple startup screen for the Flow framework
and is part of the default distribution. If you develop your own application,
you don't need it at all.

If you want to use the Flow framework, please have a look at the `Flow documentation
<http://flowframework.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_
